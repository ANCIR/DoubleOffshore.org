Belize,Yes,33,Central America and Caribbean ,,331 900,97,0,"The jurisdiction, a tax haven connected to the City of London network, markets itself under as a ‘friendly flag’ providing attractive taxes and fees. Entities providing secrecy services advertise that for a initial total fee of $393, vessels, including oil rigs, can be registered in one day to any nationality. For an annual cost of less than $6000, ships of 10 000 G.T or more can maintain good standing. Opacity ring-fenced for foreign entities allow for bearer shares, zero disclosure, zero taxes, nominee representatives, and zero requirements for audits, tax returns, or annual accounts to be provided or filed. Under Belize law, the ship owner is not the actual owner, but the registered owner which can be concealed by nominees.[1] Various layers of secrecy within, and interlocked between, other tax havens can create opacity blocked by sovereign laws. In 2013, following scandal, the government took formal control of the International Business Companies Registry (IBCR) operated by a private company, Belize International Services Limited (BISL), which has created more than 100 000 companies. BISL was co-owned by UK-billionaire and major Tory party donor Lord Ashcroft via 77% stake in Waterloo Investment Holdings Limited (WIHL), based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), and Panamanian law firm Morgan & Morgan[2]. Following the government’s action, WIHL released a press statement claiming, ‘disappointment and outrage at the Government of Belize’s unilateral decision…to assume control.’[3] Belize ranks 33 on the global maritime registry. The bulk of large ships are foreign-owned with China accounting for more than 30%. West African offshore oil industries such as Nigeria are connected to Belize for oil rigs.",80,52,http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/database/Belize.xml,http://www.immarbe.com/IMMARBELIB/belize_merchantshipsact.pdf,Yes,247,152,tbc,China,---,9,1,https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bh.html#Trans,http://www.milonline.com/companies/belize-offshore-companies.html & http://www.belizeoffshoreinvestors.com/off14.html,http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?c=bh&v=88,Does not adequately curtail banking secrecy,Does not maintain company ownership details in official records,Does not disclose or prevent trusts and foundation,Does not require company ownership details are publicly available online,Does not require that company accounts be available on the public record ,Does not require that paying agents must disclose to domestic tax authorities about payments to non-residents,Does not avoid promoting tax evasion via a tax credit system,Does not use appropriate tools for efficiently analysing tax related information,Allows harmful legal vehicles,Does not comply with international anti-money laundering standards,"As of 31 May, 2012, Belize had at least 46 bilateral tax information sharing",Partly ratified relevant international treaties relating to financial,Does not cooperate with other states on money laundering and other criminal,http://www.wwf.org.uk/filelibrary/pdf/flagsofconvenience.pdf
